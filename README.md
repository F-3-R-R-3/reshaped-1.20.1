ReShaped adds a radial menu that allows you to quickly and intuitively switch between different block shape variants, avoiding unnecessary inventory hassle.  
It also introduces a large collection of additional shape variants, giving builders more flexibility and control when designing structures.

## Features

### Quick-to-use radial menu
The radial menu displays all available shape variants of the block you are currently holding in your main hand and lets you swap between them instantly.  
Default keybind: Left Alt

### Automatically generated shape variants for vanilla and modded blocks
Includes vertical slabs, vertical stairs, steps, corner blocks, and more.  
Additional block types, such as panel blocks, are planned for the future.

Below is an example showing all generated blocks when another mod is installed (Create mod in this case):

Quickly preview all available blocks in creative mode using:

```


### Mixable blocks
Almost all block shapes are mixable, allowing the use of multiple materials within a single block.
